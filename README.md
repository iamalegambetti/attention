# Attention is Indeed Needed

## Overview

This GitHub repository aims to demystify the revolutionary paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al., and provide a simple, educational implementation of its key components in PyTorch.

**Project Objective**: Understand, implement, and experiment with the fundamental concepts behind the attention mechanism and transformer layers, as introduced in the paper.

## Structure

- attention/
    - decoder.py implements an attention decoder.
    - encoder.py implements an attention encoder.

- optimize/
    - tester.py implements testing methods for toy implementations.
    - trainer.py implements training methods for toy implementations.

- tests/
    - includes various tests for toy datasets.


## Requirements

- torch==2.10
